# Better Clockify

Improvements for clockify.me. Just time entry rounding for now. Maybe more in the future.

## Instructions

1. Go to https://app.clockify.me/tracker
2. Click the extension icon to round all time entries on the page to the nearest 15 minutes.

> ☝️ If rounding an entry would make it 00:00:00, it will instead get rounded up to 15 minutes.
